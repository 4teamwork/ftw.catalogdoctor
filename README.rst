Introduction
============

The package ``ftw.catalogdoctor`` provides healthcheck to find
inconsistencies in ``portal_catalog`` and surgery to remove some of them. It
can be run via a ``zopectl.command``.


Healthcheck
===========

Lists inconsistencies detected in ``portal_catalog``. Finds inconsistencies by
inspecting the catalog's internal data structures. It currently uses ``paths``
(the rid-path mapping), ``uids`` (the path-rid mapping), the ``UID`` index and
catalog metadata to determine if the catalog is healthy or if there are
problems. Healtcheck is a read-only operation and won't modify the catalog.

It can be run as follows:

.. code:: sh

    $ bin/instance doctor healtcheck


Surgery
=======

Attempts to fix issues found by ``healthcheck``. Will do a healtchcheck before
surgery, then attempt surgery and finally do a post-surgery healthcheck.
Surgery is a write operation but changes are only committed to the database if
the post-surgery healtcheck yields no more health problems.
Currently the set of available surgery is limited to problems we have observed
in production.


It can be run as follows:

.. code:: sh

    $ bin/instance doctor surgery


There is also a `--dry-run` parameter that prevents committing changes.

.. code:: sh

    $ bin/instance doctor --dry-run surgery
